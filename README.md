vrJASS2
=======
This is the new version of my compiler vrJASS. It aims to have a very high
percentage of compatibility with vJASS. In fact, that is the primary goal of 
this project.

Goals
=====
1. 100% compatibility with vJASS
2. LanguageServer (service to provide autocompletes, errors, etc. in editors)

How to manually compile grammar?
================================
ANTLR Version: 4.5.3

```
cd path/to/vrj
gradle buildGrammar
```

How to compile?
===============
Does not requires the compiled grammar (it will do it automatically).

```
cd path/to/vrj
gradle build
```

How to use it?
==============
```
cd path/to/vrj/builds/libs
java -jar vrjc.jar file1.j file2.j ...
```

For the moment, it will only translate or throw errors in the console (stdout).

Keep in mind that this is a very unstable version and many features are not 
implemented yet.

Project structure
=================
- **src/main/java/ruke/vrj/antlr:** All related to ANTLR (lexer, parser, etc.).
- **src/main/java/ruke/vrj/compiler:** Compile, run phases, store results.
- **src/main/java/ruke/vrj/phase:** Phases of the compiler. That is definition, 
typechecking & translation.
- **src/main/java/ruke/vrj/translator:** Classes that handle how each expession 
will be translated.
- **src/main/java/ruke/vrj/util**
- **src/main/java/ruke/vrj/exceptions**

Code style
==========
[Google Java Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)

Code style check
================
```
gradle check
```

Code style auto fix
===================
```
java -jar bin/google-java-format.java --relace path/to/vrj/**/*.java
```

Symbol
======
It will contain information (for example, where it was declared) about 
an specific element (meaning variables, functions, structs, libraries, etc.).

SymbolTable
===========
Maps a name (string) to a symbol. It will also provide functionality to fetch 
these symbols.

Definition phase
================
It will handle the declaration of symbols (for example variables, functions, etc.) 
and it will catch already defined errors.

TypeCheck phase
===============
It will handle the checking of the program (for example if a variable is used 
it will check that it is in fact declared).

Translation phase
=================
It will handle the translation of the program, from vrJASS to raw JASS.

Want to contribute?
===================
Great!, here are a few steps:

1. Fork the project
2. Open an issue describing what are you going to be working on (so we don't duplicate efforts)
3. Create a new branch from `master` to work on your feature (`git checkout -b ISSUE_ID/breaf-feature-description`).
4. Create tests that ensure the code does what it must
5. Finish the feature
6. Pull request!

If you're not sure of your code, don't worry, send a pull request 
and we will check it together ^^

Want to suggest a feature?
==========================
Great!, here are a few steps:

1. Create an issue
2. Describe the feature
3. Describe the problem that solves
4. Write a few usage examples
5. Describe how could it be translated into raw JASS (optional)

Please keep in mind that not all feature suggestions are going to be implemented or 
that it could take a while to do so.

**Important: your feature cannot change or break the behavior of vJASS code
(remember, vrJASS2' primary goal is to achieve full compatibility with vJASS).**
